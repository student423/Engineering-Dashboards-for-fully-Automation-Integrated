# 📊 Engineering College – Automated Student, Faculty & Placement Analytics System
Power BI • Data Automation • Excel Pipeline • DAX • End-to-End BI Project

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project delivers a fully automated analytics ecosystem for an Engineering College by integrating 
structured Excel datasets with Power BI folder-based data ingestion.

The system is designed so that whenever new data is added to Excel—new rows, new columns, new departments, 
or new academic years—the dashboards automatically refresh without any manual changes.

This makes it a future-ready, scalable, and real-time analytics solution for college administration, HODs, faculty, and placement cells.

# 🎯 Key Objectives

Build a clean, structured, dynamic Excel data model for all academic and operational entities.

Create a Power BI automated pipeline using File Folder Connector.

Develop advanced DAX-driven KPIs for student performance, faculty analysis, fees, and placement.

Provide a single source of truth for decision-making across multiple departments.

Ensure that any future Excel updates automatically flow into Power BI.

# 🏗️ Project Architecture
